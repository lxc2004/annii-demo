When i tell u i dont even see other girls pretty anymore i genuinely mean it noone has been able to top ur features from the way u smile the most genuine smiles and have the prettiest laugh ive ever heard to ur little doe eyes that melts me whenever u look at me with them and give me those eyes. The way ur so stylish babee and every outfit u wear is just so fancy and elegant that i want you to dress me up. Every little feature or thing u do is just so pretty even the way u talk, ur sense of humor even when u use that fuckass words u still manage to make them sound like the most logical and prettiest thing ever. So Never feel insecure or tell me u feel uglier now cuz from what am seeing ur getting prettier and prettier in ur own way from every time to time. ";

Thinking abt all the times u pulled me close to kiss me and leaning against the wall with me pressing on u and feeling ur hand on my face when u want to kiss me, just hearing the tone of ur voice makes me want u and want to do all those over and over again. again, Am so happy that ur the person i reach out to and ur the reason i cant sleep and ur the person i dream of and the person i get to keep and the person i get to love, thank u for being that person baby.";

We r the most couple goals that ppl should look at, icb there was a time where i used to look at maya and mayar's relationship not that i was jealous but becuz i loved what they had and thought that thats what i wanted but now i realized the only thing they had was the comfiness between each other, but we already had that and we have so much more, rememeber when u told me to always communicate with u in the begining i never rlly got it and didnt wanna go thro with it but now am so glad we ingraved that within us cuz not only do we have the comfiness but also understanding we both value each other in such a way that ive never seen before. From me keeping up when u have ur attitude shifts or to u handling my annoying ass or mood shifts. Now i can also see us becoming each other like our laughs are alike and our humor its so cute. so i love that am becoming a part of u babe and its a relationship that dont blame anyone for being jealous of and hehe now ppl get jealous of what we have and want it. I love u ";
