                My love, <br><br>
                Mi amor my beloved wife damn there r too many things to say to u, but let me first rewind to the first time I fell for u, even during that time it felt so genuine its true i always say i was irrational and didnt think when i confessed but my crush on u was so big that it didnt allow me to think anyway.
                u were perfect for me in every possible way and i was right i couldnt have been happier with anyone else as i am with u. Ngl before we started dating i was an insecure mess with every relationship i had with anyone
                I was always scared of giving too much or being to clingy and never got the validation for the mere amount of love i showed, but with u am scared of not giving u enough or loving u too little, with u am the most confident and secure ive ever felt and thats why i found a home in u and a safe place MY safe place. After our first kiss ngl i felt my emotions more hightened
                and thats when i knew there's no escape cuz not only u were an amazing gf but also a hot kisser hehe...and i just wanted more of u maybe so from there i just wanted to be urs, just so u would love me and love me and love me.. more and more 
                ik i can be childish at times or needy but its just becuz for some reason i can never get enough of u and i blame u for that ur just too good at it, and cuz ur so good at it i tend to be super jealous and obssesive over u cuz i would Not want anyone else to feel what i feel or see what i see i just want it for me (might be toxic but-). remembering everything happened with us i couldnt be more grateful that u showed me the best days and made my life more bareable.
                That one day when we went to the beach in the morning i swear that day i knew that id want to continue this life forever with u, while i was driving and ur playing and singing beside me ohmygod i just knew u were a piece of my heart, and i was looking at u with such love eyes... ur just perfect, beautiful and ive been feeling typa way ever since. so to end this, remember when i told u i wanna yab to u abt so many things and that i finally found a way to do so and in my mind 
                it was thro this website but damn when i came to write what i wanted and i was speachless my mind couldnt word out anything there was soooo many stuff i wanted to talk to u abt that i feel u NEED to hear just to know how much u mean to me and how much of an amazing person u r so in advance am sorry to not be the most expressive but ill try my best more often to be so cuz not just today or in our anniversary or birthday that u deserve to listen abt how amazing u r, it should be an everyday thing.
                I love u so much babe more than words could ever tell. happy one year my love.
